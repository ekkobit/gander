# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge, to the extent possible, to making 
participation in our project and our community a good experience for 
everyone.

## Our Standards

* Fairly good manners and reasonably civil discourse
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Somewhat graceful acceptance of constructive criticism
* Attempted focus on the issue at hand, rather than the promotion of 
  hard held beliefs
 
## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at resonate@ekkobit.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
