**Firstly, thanks for taking an interest in deveoping Gander!**

The process of making a contribution to Gander is like so:

3. Create a pull request

You can find issues to work on under the issues tab. If you don't anything interesting there, then you're welcome to open a new issue and work on it yourself --- or hope that soemone else will!

**Main areaes of development**

Gander is currently in alpha, so not feature complete.  This means that popular indicators are still lacking. Some indicators also, commonly, have plots that require verbose matplotlib coding. In these instances, plotting functions are also a good idea. A central idea behind the Gander project is also strong documentation of the technical theory behind each indicator, so this is also an area where contributions are sought after.

Happy coding (and trading)!
