In the following text --- and in the code ---, we adopt the convention that
*window* means a number of previous data points + the current data point.
*n_sma, n_ema* etc. and the number in *EMA3, L14, H14* etc. is the
*window* --- the current data point, i.e only previous data points. The
distinction is important in order avoid confusion.
