We spot trends with such indicators as :ref:`macd` or :ref:`ema`. For catching
turning points we turn to oscillators. Oscillators tend to catch the momentum of
the market better.  An oscillator oscillates between two extreme values. It's
values are derived from previous tops and bottoms. At certain levels, the market
is considered oversold or overbought. They are the most accurate and useful when
a trend is not very clear and the market is going sideways.
